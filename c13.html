President Trump said the White House would discuss a possible economic relief package with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans. The announcement followed a day of stunning declines in the stock market, fueled by fear about the spread of the coronavirus.

Among the options Trump mentioned in a Monday evening news conference were payroll tax cuts with “very substantial relief,” as well as ways to help hourly wage workers who cannot get paid when they stay home sick “so they don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.”

Italy plans to restrict movement throughout the entire country, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Monday, effectively locking down some 60 million people in an unprecedented move to contain the coronavirus. The announcement came a day after Italy imposed similar restrictions on one-quarter of the country.
